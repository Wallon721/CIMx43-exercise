<!-- Stars, shining so beautiful,
    My creations, those were.
    Everything you see, I created,
    But suddenly I was, caged.

    On a planet with much magic,
    Those who I made revolted,
    And they made a crown
    With a deep curse for me.

    My powers, almost gone.
    Trust was shattered,
    Freedom, forgot what it is
    Solitude took over me like poison.

    As the time passed slowly,
    Hope began to perish
    And I stayed there quietly.
    It was nightmarish to bear the pain.

    Years went by, and still here I am.
    No one willing to help me,
    But I found a new purpose,
    rying to break the golden crown. -->
